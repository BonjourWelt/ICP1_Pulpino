TLC notes:

hat's a great clue â€” the difference between:

./run_script

and

source run_script

is very significant in how the shell handles execution and environment.

When you run:

source run_script

You're telling your current shell to execute the script inline, not as a subprocess. This means:

    exit statements inside the script will exit your entire shell session ðŸ˜¬

    cd affects your current directory

    Environment variables or sourced scripts like setup2022.efd stay in your shell

    make clean, make, and file manipulations are happening in your live shell context

So if anything in your script:

    Calls exit, it will kill your terminal session

    Assumes it's running in isolation (e.g., cd ./build then expects to exit after)

    Relies on source loading build env into a subshell

â€¦then source run_script will cause problems.

 Why ./run_script Works

This executes the script in a separate Bash process, so:

    exit exits only the script

    cd changes affect only that subprocess

    Environment pollution is contained


variable names are case sensitive
