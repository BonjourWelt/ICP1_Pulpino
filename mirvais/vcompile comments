rm -rf modelsim_libs
vlib modelsim_libs          # creates directory: ./modelsim_libs

rm -rf work
vlib work                   # creates directory: ./work

rm -rf $LIB_PATH            # deletes: ${MSIM_LIBS_PATH}/pulpino_lib
vlib $LIB_PATH              # creates library at that path
vmap $LIB_NAME $LIB_PATH    # maps logical lib name 'pulpino_lib' to that path


 HOW vlog BEHAVES
ModelSim's vlog -work <lib> compiles files into:

    The library database at the specified -work location.

    It creates .db, .dat, .vhdl, etc. files inside that library folder.

YOUR COMPILE TARGETS
âœ… Synthesized Netlist

vlog -quiet-sv -work /export/.../pulp_PnR.v
This is incorrect usage. You're using -work <absolute_path_to_a_file>, which is invalid.
ModelSim expects a library name (like work or pulpino_lib) with -work, not a path to a file.
Dix this:
vlog -quiet -sv -work $LIB_NAME ${PULP_PATH}/path/to/pulp_PnR.v
Assuming $LIB_NAME is still set to "pulpino_lib" and vmap is done correctly.
